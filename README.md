## About the app

- The main goal to make this app was to learn the basics of Jetpack Compose along with other architecture components like Navigation, Dagger-Hilt and Retrofit.
- The app uses [OpenWeatherMap One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to fetch current, hourly, and daily(7 days) weather updates.

## Architecture

- The app uses MVVM [Model-View-ViewModel] architecture to have a unidirectional flow of data, separation of concern, testability, and a lot more.

## Design

- Design for the app is inspired from [Furkansin](https://github.com/furkanaskin/Weatherapp).
- Weather icons are taken from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icon/set/weather/color) under its free-tier subscription.

## About Jetpack Compose

* Jetpack Compose is a modern Android UI toolkit introduced by Google.
* It simplifies the app development process and speeds it up.
* With Jetpack Compose, you can write less code compared to the current view building approach â€“ which also means less potential bugs.
* There is one more great thing about it â€“ it uses Kotlin.
* Compose is not fully bug-free at the moment but has great support and is surely the next big thing in Native Android Development.
* You can learn more about Compose here: [Compose Codelabs by Google](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/compose)
